# CodeWarsPuzzles
CodeWars.com is a website that gives short yet difficult programming challenges. These challenges (called 'kata') are mathematical and algorithmic problems. I have found them to be an invaluable resource in learning how to approach problems algorithmically. In the files for this repository, the commented lines are the prompts for the challenges, created by users of the website. The following code is entirely my own original solution. I received no outside help in solving the challenges (except of course looking up syntax on stackoverflow). The solutions curated here display my solutions to the most difficult problems I was able to solve.

If you would like to see all of my completed solutions (as well as my failed attempts) you can visit my CodeWars profile at:
